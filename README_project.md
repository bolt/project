Bolt 5 standard project skeleton
================================

Welcome! This is a Bolt 5 project, set up using `composer create-project`. If
you are the developer of this project, you can modify this README to the
specifics of your project. Below are the general instructions to set up a _new_
project, based off the same skeleton.


Note: If you're updating from an earlier beta, read UPDATE.md for details.

---

Set up a new Bolt 4 project, using the following command, replacing
`myprojectname` with your desired project's name.

```bash
composer create-project bolt/project myprojectname
```

Navigate into the newly created folder, and configure the database in `.env`.
You can skip this step, if you'd like to use SQLite.

```dotenv
# SQLite
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data/bolt.sqlite

# MySQL
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:"root%1"@127.0.0.1:3306/four
```

Set up the database, create the first user and add fixtures (dummy content):

```bash
bin/console bolt:setup
```

Run Bolt using the built-in webserver, Symfony CLI, Docker or your own
preferred webserver:

```bash
bin/console server:start
```

orâ€¦

```bash
symfony server:start -d
symfony open:local
```

Finally, open the new installation in a browser. If you've used one of the
commands above, you'll find the frontpage at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ \
The Bolt admin panel can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt

Log in using the credentials you created when setting up the first user.
